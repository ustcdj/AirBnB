## Introduction
This analysis focuses on Airbnb listing price in Boston and Seattle and tries to answer questions below:
1. Is there any trend in Airbnb listing price? How does price compare between Boston and Seattle?
2. Should you become a superhost?
3. What factors affect the Airbnb listing price?

## Analysis
The Seattle and Boston Airbnb datasets are from Kaggle. The Seattle dataset has 3818 records and the Boston dataset has 3585 records. The `feat_info.csv` file has necessary actions for each independent variable during the data preparation step.

- Preprocessing
 - Drop features that have high correlations with other features.
 - Drop records that have ridiculously high listing price.
 - Drop rows with more than 30% missing values.
 - Impute nulls with mean for numeric features and mode for integer/fixed values.
 - OneHotEncoder categorical features.
 - Scale features with StandardScaler.
- Split the data into train and test
- Use LassoCV to perform feature selection and to find best model (alpha) automatically
